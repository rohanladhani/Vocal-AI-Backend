      "CraigVenter_2008 1 Craig_Venter 297.29 307.79 <F0_M> part of the design is designing pieces that are fifty letters long that have to overlap with all the other fifty letter pieces to build smaller sub units\n",
      "CraigVenter_2008 1 Craig_Venter 307.79 327.39 <F0_M> we have to design so they can go together we design unique elements into this you may have read that we put watermarks in think of this we have a four letter genetic code a c g and t triplets of that letter of those letters code for roughly twenty amino acids that there 's a single letter\n",

      "CraigVenter_2008 1 Craig_Venter 356.97 376.46 <F0_M> fit those together to make twenty four thousand letter pieces then put sets of those going up to seventy two thousand at each stage we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we 're trying to create a process that 's extremely robust that you can see in a minute we 're trying to get to the point of automation\n",

      "CraigVenter_2008 1 Craig_Venter 404.00 415.08 <F0_M> here is an example of it there 's an organism called deinococcus radiodurans that can take three millions rads of radiation you can see in the top panel its chromosome just gets blown apart\n",
      "CraigVenter_2008 1 Craig_Venter 415.08 427.36 <F0_M> twelve to twenty four hours later it put it back together exactly as it was before we have thousands of organisms that can do this these organisms can be totally desiccated they can live in a vacuum\n",

      "CraigVenter_2008 1 Craig_Venter 479.22 497.31 <F0_M> if we print printed out at a ten font with no spacing it takes a hundred and forty two pages just to print this genetic code well how do we boot up a chromosome how how do we activate this obviously with a virus it 's pretty simple it 's much more complicated dealing with bacteria\n",
      "CraigVenter_2008 1 Craig_Venter 497.31 512.64 <F0_M> it 's also simpler when you go into eukaryotes like ourselves you can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one and that 's what you 've all heard about with cloning with bacteria archaea the chromosome is integrated into the cell\n",
      "CraigVenter_2008 1 Craig_Venter 512.64 528.19 <F0_M> but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it we purified a chromosome from one microbial species roughly these two are as distant as human and mice\n",
      "CraigVenter_2008 1 Craig_Venter 528.19 544.03 <F0_M> we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell and you 'll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here\n",
      "CraigVenter_2008 1 Craig_Venter 544.03 552.14 <F0_M> the new chromosome went into the cell in fact we thought this might be as far as it went but we tried to design the process a little bit further\n",
      "CraigVenter_2008 1 Craig_Venter 552.14 571.84 <F0_M> this is a major mechanism of evolution right here we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species so people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology\n",
      "CraigVenter_2008 1 Craig_Venter 571.84 596.00 <F0_M> there 's enzymes called restriction enzymes that actually digest dna the chromosome that was in the cell doesn 't have one the cell the chromosome we put in does it got expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material chewed it up and so we ended up just with the cell with the new chromosome it turned blue because of the genes we put in it\n",
      "CraigVenter_2008 1 Craig_Venter 596.00 607.69 <F0_M> and with a very short period of time all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell\n",
      "CraigVenter_2008 1 Craig_Venter 607.69 614.46 <F0_M> all the proteins changed the membranes changed when we read the genetic code it 's exactly what we had transferred in\n",

      "DavidMerrill_2009 1 David_Merrill 41.11 53.61 <F0_M> what if when we used a computer instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically arranging it the way we wanted\n",
      "DavidMerrill_2009 1 David_Merrill 53.61 58.99 <F0_M> this question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer by building siftables\n",
      "DavidMerrill_2009 1 David_Merrill 58.99 70.51 <F0_M> in a nutshell a siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie they 're able to be moved around by hand they can sense each other they can sense their motion and they have a screen and a wireless radio\n",
      "DavidMerrill_2009 1 David_Merrill 70.51 81.51 <F0_M> most importantly they 're physical so like the blocks you can move them just by reaching out and grasping and siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information\n",
      "DavidMerrill_2009 1 David_Merrill 81.51 99.81 <F0_M> and as these tools become more physical more aware of their motion aware of each other and aware of the nuance of how we move them we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles so i 'm going to start with some simple examples this siftable is configured to show video and if i tilt it in one direction it 'll roll the video this way if i tilt it the other way\n",
      "DavidMerrill_2009 1 David_Merrill 99.81 107.29 <F0_M> it rolls it backwards and these interactive portraits are aware of each other so if i put them next to each other they get interested\n",
      "DavidMerrill_2009 1 David_Merrill 107.29 116.59 <F0_M> if they get surrounded they notice that too they might get a little flustered and they can also sense their motion and tilt\n",
      "DavidMerrill_2009 1 David_Merrill 116.59 124.24 <F0_M> so one of the interesting implications on interaction we started to realize was that we could use everyday gestures on data\n",
      "DavidMerrill_2009 1 David_Merrill 124.24 137.32 <F0_M> like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid so in this case we 've got three siftables configured to be paint buckets and i can use them to pour color into that central one where they get mixed if we overshoot we can pour a little bit back\n",
